
# REST API with Express Project

## Description

The API provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, as well as adding, updating and deleting courses in the database. Users must have an account and be logged-in to make changes to the database.

This project uses REST API design, Node.js, and Express to create API routes, along with the Sequelize ORM for data modeling, validation, and persistence. Testing was done using Postman, a Postman Testing package is provided via a JSON file.
